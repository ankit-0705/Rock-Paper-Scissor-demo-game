Title: Rock Paper Scissors Game

Description:
This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the user can select their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) by clicking on the corresponding image. The computer then randomly selects its move, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
